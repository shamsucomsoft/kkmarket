# **Kantin Kwari Market: Professional E-commerce Implementation Guide**

## **1\. Product & UX Specification**

This section details the user-facing features, user flows, and key experience considerations.

### **1.1 Core User Experience Principles**

- **Mobile-First Design:** All screens must be designed for an optimal mobile experience first, then adapted for desktop.
- **Performance:** Target a page load time of \< 2 seconds for all critical user paths.
- **Clarity & Feedback:** The user must always be aware of the system's status through visual feedback (loaders, toasts, success messages) and clear error handling.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### **1.2 UI Screens & Functions (Expanded)**

#### **1.2.1 Search & Discovery**

- **Home Screen:**
  - **Search Bar:** Now includes auto-completion and suggestions for products, categories, and vendors.
- **Search Results Screen:**
  - **Faceted Search:** Filters for price range, color, material, and average rating.
  - **Sorting:** Options to sort results by "Newest," "Price: Low to High," "Price: High to Low," and "Top Rated."
  - **Empty State:** A user-friendly message and illustration when no results are found, suggesting alternative search terms.

#### **1.2.2 Product & Vendor Experience**

- **Product Detail Screen:**
  - **Product Variants:** If a product has variations (e.g., different colors, yards), users can select them. The displayed price and image will update dynamically based on the selection. Stock availability will be shown for the selected variant.
  - **Wishlist Functionality:** An icon/button to add a product to a personal wishlist.
- **Vendor Profile Screen:**
  - Includes a "Products" tab and a "Reviews" tab to organize content.

#### **1.2.3 Cart & Checkout Flow**

- **Shopping Cart Screen:**
  - **Out-of-Stock Handling:** If an item in the cart goes out of stock before checkout, it is visually flagged, and the user cannot proceed until it's removed.
- **Checkout Screen:**
  - **Address Management:** Users can save multiple shipping addresses to their profile for faster checkout.

#### **1.2.4 User Account Management**

- **User Order History Screen:**
  - Detailed view now includes a tracking number (if provided by the vendor) and a link to the courier's tracking page.
- **Wishlist Screen (New):**
  - A dedicated screen accessible from the user's profile to view all saved items. Users can move items from the wishlist directly to the cart.

### **1.3 Vendor-Facing Screens (Expanded)**

#### **1.3.1 Onboarding & Dashboard**

- **Vendor Onboarding:** First-time login triggers a guided tour or a checklist of setup steps (e.g., "Complete Profile," "Add First Product," "Set Up Payouts").
- **Vendor Dashboard:**
  - **Key Metrics:** Now includes interactive charts for sales over time (7, 30, 90 days).
  - **Notifications Panel:** A dedicated area for important alerts (e.g., "New Order Received," "Stock Low for Product X").

#### **1.3.2 Inventory & Order Management**

- **Inventory Management Screen:**
  - **Product Variants:** The "Add/Edit Product" form now includes a section to define variants (e.g., Color: Red, Blue; Size: 4 yards, 6 yards) and set individual stock levels and prices for each combination.
  - **Low Stock Alerts:** Products with stock below a vendor-defined threshold are flagged.
- **Order Management Screen:**
  - **Order Details:** Now includes a button to "Print Packing Slip."
  - **Status Updates:** Updating an order status (e.g., to "Shipped") prompts the vendor to enter a tracking number. This triggers an automated email/in-app notification to the customer.

#### **1.3.3 Vendor Finance (New)**

- **Payouts Screen:**
  - A dashboard for vendors to view their sales, platform fees, and net earnings.
  - Shows a history of past payouts and the scheduled date for the next payout.
  - An interface to connect their bank account for direct deposits.

### **1.4 Platform Admin Panel (New)**

A separate, secure interface for platform administrators.

- **Admin Dashboard:** Overview of platform health: new users, new vendors, total sales, open support tickets.

- **User Management:** View all users, manage roles, and handle support escalations.
- **Dispute Resolution:** A module to mediate and resolve disputes between buyers and sellers.

## **2\. Engineering & API Specification**

### **2.1 General Architectural Considerations**

- **Authentication:** All private endpoints must be protected via JWT Bearer Tokens.
- **Authorization (RBAC):** The API will enforce role-based access control. Roles: `user`, `vendor`, `admin`.
- **Pagination:** All list-based endpoints **must** be paginated. Requests should accept `page` and `limit` query parameters. Responses will be wrapped in a pagination object.
- **Standardized Error Response:** Errors will use a consistent format: `{ "status": "error", "statusCode": 404, "message": "Resource not found" }`.
- **Image Handling:** All image uploads will be handled by a dedicated service (e.g., AWS S3). The API will handle the file stream and upload asynchronously.
- **Search:** A dedicated search service (e.g., Elasticsearch, Algolia) is required for faceted search and performance.
- **Background Jobs:** All non-critical, time-consuming tasks (sending emails, processing images) will be handled by a background job queue (e.g., Redis/BullMQ).

### **2.2 API Endpoints (Expanded & Completed)**
